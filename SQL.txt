What is SQL used for?

SQL is an essential part of the technology stack for many organizations and is widely used in business, government, and scientific applications across many roles including: Data Analysts, Business Intelligence Analysts, Data Scientists, Database Developers, and Data Engineers. SQL is used by organizations to interact with databases which store and manage data in a structured and efficient way.

The following are common tasks that people use SQL for:

    Creating, modifying, and deleting database tables and records
    Inserting, updating, and deleting data in a database
    Retrieving data from a database with SELECT statements
    Grouping and aggregating data
    Joining data from multiple tables
    Creating views and stored procedures
    Performing data analysis and data mining
    Managing the security and permissions of a database
    Monitoring and optimizing database performance
    Backing up and restoring databases




EX:Statements, Functions, and Clauses

If you are learning SQL, you’ll see different components, and it’s important to understand what they are used for:

    Statements: Used to carry out tasks in the database
    Examples: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, CREATE, GRANT, REVOKE
    Clauses: Components of SQL statements that specify specific conditions, restrictions or operations to be performed
    Examples: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, JOIN, UNION, WITH
    Expressions: Combinations of values, operators, and functions that produce a single value
    Examples: mathematical operations, concatenation, Functions, CASE, Subquery
    Predicates: Conditions that evaluate to either true, false or unknown in SQL. They are used in the WHERE clause of SQL to specify a subset of rows to be returned from a database table
    Examples: Equality, Inequality, Comparison, BETWEEN, LIKE, NULL, AND, OR, NOT
    Operators: Symbols or keywords used to perform operations and comparisons in SQL expressions
    Examples: Arithmetic, Comparison, Logical, IN, LIKE, BETWEEN, IS NULL
    Functions: Built-in or user-defined operations that perform specific calculations or manipulations on data. Examples: Aggregates, Date & Time, String, Conversion, Mathematical
    Data types: Specify and define the type of data that a column in a table can hold
    Examples: Numeric, Characters and Strings, Date & Time, Binary, Boolean
    Keywords: Special reserved words used in SQL that have a specific meaning and cannot be used as identifiers (such as table or column names) without being quoted
    Examples: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, AND, OR.

You can always write detailed queries using SQL for your desired use case. But if you want to explore making it a little easier on yourself, Coginiti has features to help you analyze your data if you forgot to write the SQL or you’re simply still learning. As an example, Coginiti has an advanced grid to quickly filter, sort, pivot, and aggregate your data.
